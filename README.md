# NextReach Studio

https://www.nextreachstudio.com — Custom web applications, AI automation, and internal tools for ambitious SMBs and startups. Founded and operated out of Pune, India.

Built with **Astro 6**, **React 19**, **Tailwind CSS v4**, and deployed on **Vercel** (static).

## Positioning

**Tagline:** Enterprise engineering discipline. Startup speed and pricing.

NextReach Studio is a founder-led, senior-engineered software studio. We compete against traditional agencies by offering direct senior developer access, fixed-scope one-time pricing, and bi-weekly sprint delivery. No account managers. No inflated retainers. No scope creep.

**Ideal clients:**
- Local Indian SMBs digitizing workflows (trade, logistics, service businesses)
- International startups needing rapid MVPs (2–6 week delivery)
- Growing businesses needing internal dashboards, automation, or custom portals

## Site Overview

The website serves two audiences:

1. **Clients (primary)** — Businesses evaluating the studio for custom software. Pages: Homepage, Services, Portfolio, About, Contact.
2. **AI Developers (community/SEO)** — Developers seeking free LLM tools, guides, and blog content. Pages: Tools (5 calculators), Blog (5 posts), Guides (2 guides), Resources (2 directories).

This dual-audience strategy builds authority through developer tools while the core pages convert software buyers.

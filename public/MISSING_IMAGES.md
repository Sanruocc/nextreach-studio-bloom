# Missing Images for SEO

The following images need to be created and added to the `/public` folder for optimal SEO and social media sharing:

## Required Images:

### 1. `/public/og-image.jpg`
- **Size**: 1200x630 pixels
- **Format**: JPG or PNG
- **Purpose**: Open Graph image for social media sharing
- **Content**: NextReach Studio logo and branding

### 2. `/public/twitter-card.jpg`
- **Size**: 1200x600 pixels  
- **Format**: JPG or PNG
- **Purpose**: Twitter card image
- **Content**: NextReach Studio logo and branding

## Temporary Solution:
Until proper images are created, the system will fall back to:
- `/nextreach-logo.jpg` (already exists)

## Design Guidelines:
- Include "NextReach Studio" text
- Use brand colors (green to blue gradient)
- Include tagline: "Professional Web Design & Development"
- Ensure readability when scaled down
- Use high contrast for text visibility

## Tools for Creation:
- Canva (recommended for quick creation)
- Figma
- Adobe Photoshop/Illustrator
- Online OG image generators

const fadeInVariants = {
  hidden: { opacity: 0, y: 20 },
  visible: { 
    opacity: 1, 
    y: 0,
    transition: { duration: 0.6, ease: "easeOut" }
  }
};

// Staggered animation for lists
const staggerContainer = {
  hidden: { opacity: 0 },
  visible: {
    opacity: 1,
    transition: {
      staggerChildren: 0.1,
      delayChildren: 0.2
    }
  }
};
```

#### Micro-Interactions
- Button hover effects with subtle scale and shadow changes
- Card hover animations with gentle lift and shadow enhancement
- Form input focus states with smooth transitions
- Loading states with professional spinners and skeleton screens

### Image and Media Strategy

#### Professional Image Placeholder System
```typescript
interface ImagePlaceholderProps {
  category: 'hero' | 'project' | 'team' | 'client-logo' | 'testimonial';
  aspectRatio: string;
  alt: string;
  priority?: boolean;
}
```

**Placeholder Categories:**
1. **Hero Images**: Professional workspace, technology, or abstract business imagery
2. **Project Screenshots**: Realistic website mockups and application interfaces
3. **Team Photos**: Professional headshots with consistent styling
4. **Client Logos**: Placeholder company logos with proper branding
5. **Background Images**: Subtle patterns and gradients

#### Image Optimization Strategy
- WebP format with fallbacks
